Notes:
Redux vs Context
Context is not a great replacement for Redux
Redux provides way to distribute data to various components throughout our app hierarchy
...it provides a way to store data in a centralized store
... and it Provides means to change data inside that store
Context does not have that functionality
All we can do is distribute data to various components
